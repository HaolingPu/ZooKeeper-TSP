# TSP-for-zoo
Find the MST for the zoo to connect all the animal cages in zoo by using Prim's algorithm with dense map. Using cheapest insertion algorithm to find the FASTTSP or hamiltonian path for the zookeeper to follow and clean all the cages. Optimize the TSP with B.a.B for zookeeper to return to the original starting point when he finish cleaning.
